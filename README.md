#Piwik AdminNotification Plugin
##Description
Adds the ability for Piwik administrators to include an informative message on all users' dashboards. This may be useful for communicating with users in larger shared environments. In our setup we were tracking 1,900 websites with 250 users. This is a solution we wrote to allow us to easily inform our users of maintainance windows.

##Instructions
The easiest way to install is to find the plugin in the [Piwik Marketplace](http://plugins.piwik.org/).
